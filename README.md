# USAGE

asdfasdf depends on [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery.cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie). Just add them if your are not using them and init calling asdfasdf.js (is not needed to wait until the DOM is ready)

```HTML
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/asdfasdf.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" >
        asdfasdf();
  </script>
```

Or include it from a CDN:

```HTML
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jupegarnica/asdfasdf.js/gh-pages/asdfasdf.min.js"></script>
```

asdfasdf is totally configurable passing a setting object when called.
```javascript
  asdfasdf({elements:'input.autosave'});
```
The default setting is:

```javascript
 var defaultsetting = {
        //show feedback when autosave data
        showFeedback: true,  

        //show feedback when autoload data
        showLoaded: true,     

        // feedback message properties
        msgLoadDataText: "Data Loaded",
        msgStyle: "position: fixed;top: 2em;color: white;background: tomato;right: 50%;transform: translateX(50%);width: auto;display: inline-block;padding: 0.5em;border-radius: 0.3em;text-transform: uppercase;",
        msgText: "auto saved",
        msgHide: 500,

        //Elements to be saved
        elements: 'input, textarea, select',

        //Time to keep the data
        expires: 2,
    }
```
